To-do List App
===============================

## Summary of project
* This is a to-do list application created and uploaded for Surely Group technical test
* The application includes the ability to list, create new tasks, delete and edit existing tasks
* The technologies used were AngularJS for front-end, Symfony3 for a basic REST API and Doctrine ORM for database persistence
* I would advise to run this application using Laravel Homestead (this was used for local development)
